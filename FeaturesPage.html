<br>through hackathons based on attendees, ranks of companies attending, 
<br>cost of traveling there and back dependent on compensation

<br>as Google Code Jam and various other competitions.Our search engine will
<br>sift these competitions based on the same parameters as the hackathons

This option is our most simplist and advanced option.Instead of you 
<br>sifting through which hackathons you want to go to you will be 
<br>given the option of inputting your search parameters and information 
<br>required for a hackathon (resume,name email,why you want to attend e.t.c) 
<br>and our state of the art A.I will set up your hackathon registration
<br>for you.Instead of having to fil out forms you will only have to sign 
<br>off on which ones you want to go and which to avoid

Companies planning on attending hackathons to try to recruit bright programmers

<br>hackathon,planned attendees and projected growth of set hackathon.
<br>the projected growth of the hackathon is based on the increase of attendence
<br>or for larger hackathons, the time it takes to fill up registration.

<br>an exorbant amount,our engineers will orchestrate and organize the meetups.
